        <h2 class="section">Preventable Diseases</h2>
    
        <p>In this visualization project, we will be creating visualizations to take a look into diseases which have been declined in the first world
        countries but are still prevalent in low-income countries.</p>
    
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, we will be using the United States as a benchmark, and we will be taking a deeper dive into the 
        10 lowest income countries in Africa. Hence, whenever we mention Africa, we are referring to the 10 lowest income 
        countries in Africa.</p>
        <p>The metric used for first 4 graph is the mortality rate per 1000. For graph 5 we used new incidence per 1000.</p>
    
    </div>

<!-- Start of Graph 1 -->
<div>
    <h3>Graph 1:</h3>
    <p>We start by comparing the most prevelant diseases in Africa (by mortality rate per 1000) to their mortality rate in the United States.<br>
        If you are curious to know what are the most prevelant diseases in the United States instead, then click to sort by United States and compare
        their corresponding mortality rate in Africa</p>
    <p>By default top 4 diseases are shown but you can see more by clicking on add button(or less by clicking on remove)! You can also hover
        over individual bars to see their mortality rate.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>Few things should catch our eye, we can see that the distribution of the mortality of Infectious and parasitic diseases, 
        Neonatal Conditions and Respitory infections is very one sided. Infectious and parasitic diseases includes diseases such as tubercolosis, 
        STDs, HIV e.t.c. and they make up the largest proportion by 3 times as much.
    </p>

<br>
<p>In these force directed graph, we can compare the the nodes to see make-up of diseases in the Africa vs United States. 
    Hover over the nodes to see which disease it is and size of the node is proportional to its prevalance.

<p>The purpose of this graph is to  examine the composition of diseases in United States vs Africa</p>

<p>What piqued my interest is how infectious and parasitic diseases is by far the largest disease in
     these poor African countries, but almost non-existent in the United States.</p>
<p>Lets make chloropleth to explore this trend more.</p>

<!-- Start of Question 4 -->
<div>
    <h3>Graph 4:</h3>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="q4_plot" class="center_plot">
    </div>
    <p>Observing from the chloropleth it seems like our hypothesis is true that countries in Africa 
        are more prone to Infectious and parasitic diseases.</p>
        <p>Hovering over a country will highlight them if you are curious!</p>
    <p>We might notice the value for some of the countries is zero this is because some of the countries in my geojson did not exist in my
        original datset or vice versa.</p>

    </p>
</div>
<!-- End of Question 4 -->

<div>
    <h3>Graph 5:</h3>
    <p>One of the deadliest type of Infectious disease is HIV (excluding STIs). The graph below shows the number of new incidences of HIV(per 1000).
    All the top 4 countries are African countries, and we compare their rate to United States. <br> <br>
    
    If you are curious you can add any country from the drop down menu bar and the pattern will be clear that African countries have
    way higher HIV rates than rest of the world.<br><br>
    If the graph gets too cluttered you can use threshold to remove lines below a certain value.
    </p>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="q6_plot" class="center_plot">
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
        <select id="country-dropdown"></select>
        <button id="add-country">Add</button>
        <button id="remove-country">Remove</button>
        <button id="clear-all">Clear All</button>
        <label for="threshold">Threshold:</label>
        <input type="number" id="threshold" name="threshold">
        <button id="set-threshold">Set Threshold</button>
    </div>
    <p>This trend proves that these diseases are easily eradicable just as they have been eradicated in the first world countries.
        With financial help, they can also be eradicated in these lower income countries as more money can be alloted to healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is crucial because these are deaths that can be easily prevented with a little bit of help.
