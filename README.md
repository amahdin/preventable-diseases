# Visualizing the Disparities in Preventable Diseases: A Comparative Analysis between the United States and Low-Income African Countries

## Summary

This repository contains visualizations that highlight the stark contrast in the prevalence of preventable diseases between the United States and the ten lowest-income countries in Africa. Using mortality rates per 1000 and new incidences per 1000 as key metrics, this project explores the significant differences in disease burden between these regions. 

The visualizations include:

1. **Bar Chart**: A comparison of the most prevalent diseases in Africa and their corresponding mortality rates in the United States, with interactive features for detailed exploration.
2. **Force Directed Network Graphs**: Depictions of the composition of diseases with the highest mortality rates in both Africa and the United States, emphasizing the disparity in infectious and parasitic diseases.
3. **Choropleth Map**: A geographic representation of the prevalence of infectious and parasitic diseases in Africa, highlighting the concentration of these diseases in low-income countries.
4. **Line Graph**: An analysis of new incidences of HIV per 1000 people, comparing rates in African countries to those in the United States, with interactive features for customized viewing.

These visualizations underscore the urgent need for financial aid and healthcare interventions in low-income African countries to prevent deaths from diseases that have been largely eradicated in first-world countries. The project aims to raise awareness and drive action towards eliminating preventable diseases globally.

This repository includes the data, scripts, and visualizations necessary for replicating the analysis and exploring the data further.
